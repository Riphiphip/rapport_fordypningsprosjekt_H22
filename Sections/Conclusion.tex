\section{Conclusion}
Based on what I have learned over this past semester, it seems like MLIR and RVSDG should be a great fit. MLIR provides mechanisms and infrastructure that lend themselves nicely to implement RVSDG and various transformations on it. While a lot of work still remains to have a usable dialect, the knowledge, insights, and experience gained throughout this project will serve as a good baseline for future work.
